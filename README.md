# OpenRC
This is an open-source radio-controll transmiter firmware based on Arduino Mega 2560 and small additional DIY shield.

Additionally this RC have small TFT display and small sound speaker.

TFT Display based on ST7735 driver, e.g. I use this one http://www.adafruit.com/products/618

In this RC Transmiter you can define set of you models (Airplanes, Helicopters, Cars and other). 
Every model have own name, type, and set of config: channel mixing, stik limits and curves, ets.
